## 1. Objective
Perform a comprehensive exploratory data analysis on the YouTube channel data to gain insights into video performance, content trends, and audience engagement.
## 2. Data Collection

- Ensure all video data from the specified YouTube channel has been collected using the YouTube Data API.
- Verify that the dataset includes both regular videos and Shorts.

## 3. Data Preprocessing
### 3.1 Data Cleaning

- Handle missing values appropriately.
- Convert data types as necessary (e.g., dates to datetime objects, view counts to integers).
- Remove any duplicate entries if present.

### 3.2 Feature Engineering

Create derived features such as:
- Video age (days since publication)
- Engagement rate: $((comments*2 + likes) / views)$
- Video duration in seconds
- Day of week and hour of day for publication time

## 4. Descriptive Statistics

Calculate and present basic statistics for key metrics:

- View count
- Like count
- Comment count
- Video duration

## 5. Temporal Analysis

Analyze trends over time for:

- Video uploads frequency
- View count
- Engagement rates

Identify seasonality or periodic patterns in video performance

## 6. Content Analysis

- Analyze distribution of video types (regular vs. Shorts)
- Perform text analysis on video titles and descriptions:

    - Word frequency
    - Common phrases
    - Sentiment analysis

## 7. Performance Metrics

Compare performance metrics between regular videos and Shorts:

- Average view count
- Average engagement rate
- Publication time patterns

Identify top-performing videos and analyze their characteristics

## 8. Correlation Analysis

Investigate relationships between different metrics:

- Correlation between video duration and view count
- Correlation between publication time and view count

## 9. Audience Engagement

- Analyze comment sentiment and its relation to video performance
- Investigate the relationship between likes and comments

## 10. Visualization Requirements

Create appropriate visualizations for each analysis, including but not limited to:

- Time series plots for temporal analysis
- Bar charts for comparing metrics
- Scatter plots for correlation analysis
- Word clouds for content analysis
- Heatmaps for publication time analysis

## 11. Statistical Tests

Perform relevant statistical tests to validate observations:

- T-tests or ANOVA for comparing means between groups
- Chi-square tests for categorical data
- Regression analysis for predicting view counts

## 12. Outlier Detection

- Identify and analyze outliers in key metrics
- Determine if outliers should be treated separately or removed

## 13. Reporting

- Prepare a comprehensive report summarizing all findings
- Include actionable insights derived from the analysis
- Propose hypotheses for further investigation based on the EDA results

## 14. Tools and Technologies

- Use Python for data analysis
- Recommended libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scipy, nltk
- Jupyter Notebooks for interactive analysis and visualization
